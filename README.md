### Replicated results from RealWaste research paper 2023 (citation below)
### Citation: Single, S.; Iranmanesh, S.; Raad, R. RealWaste: A Novel Real-Life Data Set for Landfill Waste Classification Using Deep Learning. Information 2023, 14, 633. https://doi.org/10.3390/info14120633
### Preprocessed images of trash (from Real Waste Dataset) wihch are categorized into 9 different classes/types of trash.
### Split data into training and validation sets and trained a Convolutional Neural Network model to find optimal hyperparameters.
### The final CNN model acheived a test accuracy of 81.3%, similar to results from the paper.
