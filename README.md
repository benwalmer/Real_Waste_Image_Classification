# Real Waste Image Classification Project
### -Preprocessed images of trash (from Real Waste Dataset) which are categorized into 9 different classes/types of trash.
### -Split data into training and validation sets and trained a Convolutional Neural Network model to find optimal hyperparameters.
### -Used transfer learning by building a CNN on top of MobileNetV2 (Google model hosted on HuggingFace).
### The final CNN model acheived a test accuracy of 81.3%, similar to results from the initial research paper (Citation below).
